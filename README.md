# Crud - Express.Js

I'm creating this application in order to test my express.Js skills and also to have a place where i can record my daily workout.

## Installation

Running express server in development mode with nodemon (hot reload):

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

or you can just run it in production mode:

```bash
yarn && yarn build && yarn start
```
