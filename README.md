# Crud - Express.Js
I'm creating this application in order to test my express.Js skills and also to have a place where i can record my daily workout. 

## Installation
Running express server in development mode with nodemon (hot reload):
```
yarn && yarn dev
```
or you can just run it in production mode:
```
yarn && yarn build && yarn start
```
